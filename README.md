# Hash-maps-CS-261-

**hash_map_oa.py:** Hash map using open address chaining for collision resolution built upon dynamic array's. 

**hash_map_sc.py:** Hash maps using single linked list.

**a6_include.py:** Helper file (provided by the instructor) for creating the dynamic array, linked list, and hash functions.

Both programs allow user to create a hash-map, add or remove key/value pairs, clear all key/value pairs, determine if a value exists, calculate the number of empty buckets, and calculate the table load.

This was the final project for my Data Structures (DS) class. In addition to standard DS topics, the class required us to use first-principles in Python. Tuples were the only built-in data structure we were allowed to create, although we were allowed to use array indexing. Only these functions were allowed: abs(), enumerate(), int(), len(), min()/max(), print(), range(), tuple(), zip().
