# Hash-maps-CS-261-

Filename:summmary

hash_map_oa.py: hash map using open address chaining for collision resolution built upon dynamic array's. 
hash_map_sc.py: hash maps using single linked list.

Both programs allow user to create a hash-map, add or remove key/value pairs, clear all key/value pairs, determine if a value exists, calculate the number of empty buckets, and calculate the table load.

This was the final project for my Data Structures class.
